# MedTrack

A pill reminder-medication tracker application integrating appointment booking with our doctors.
I'm developing this app using Java in Android Studio using Android SDK and Google APIs. The layout has been created in XML while the backend uses Firebase, Although, it's a NoSQL database I'm planning to normalize my database within it.
